To test the functionality of PathFinder, I created various configurations of graphs such as:

- Only one node as source and destination
- Two unconnected nodes
- One node as source and destination with an additional path passing through another node
- Trying to find a path when only an edge in the opposite direction exists
- Multiple source nodes with different costs, one destination node
- A graph with two unconnected subgraphs with paths of different costs
- Two alternate paths with different costs from one source node to one destination node
